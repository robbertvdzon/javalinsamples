This project is base on the following project: link:https://github.com/robbertvdzon/javalinsamples/tree/master/javalin_base[Most simple REST application] +

This project shows how to add an endpoint that shows metrics.

This is not implemented in the application itself, but is done by setting jmx_prometheus_javaagent as the javaagent
[code]
java -javaagent:jmx_prometheus_javaagent-0.11.0.jar=8081:config.yaml -jar target\javalin_prometheus-0.1.0-shaded.jar

The applicatie then runs on http://localhost:8080/ +
The prometheus endpoint runs on http://localhost:8081/

You can edit the config.yaml to adjust de endpoint.
