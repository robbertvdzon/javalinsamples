This project shows how to use thymeleaf.

Javalin has building support for thymeleaf.

You do need to add the following dependency:
[code]
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.thymeleaf</groupId>
            <artifactId>thymeleaf</artifactId>
            <version>3.0.9.RELEASE</version>
        </dependency>

In the code you can do the following:
[source, java]
        app.get("/page", ctx -> ctx.render("/templateFile.html", model("firstName", "John", "lastName", "Doe")));


The templateFile.html can be stored in the resources folder:
[code]
  Hello <input type="text" name="userName" value="" th:value="${firstName}" />
