This project is base on the following project: link:https://github.com/robbertvdzon/javalinsamples/tree/master/javalin_base[Most simple REST application] +

This project shows how to use static files.

With Javalin, you can simply add the following to your code:
[source, java]
       app.enableStaticFiles("/html");

When you add resources/html/index.html, then that will be available under http://localhost:8080/index.html
