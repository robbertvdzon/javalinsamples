== Sample java projects faeturing a technology that can be used as an alternative for using Spring Boot.
This git repo contains multiple standalone applications, each featuring a single technology using Javalin and friends.
This can be used when you want te create your own Javalin based application and use any feature that you would expect
in a modern microservice.

*Note:*

* javalin_base is the most basic project that serves a REST call. All other projects are based on this project with only added one extra feature. +
* Each sub project also contains an integration test which starts the whole application and tests the specific feature of that project.
