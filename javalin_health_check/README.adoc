This project is base on the following project: link:https://github.com/robbertvdzon/javalinsamples/tree/master/javalin_base[Most simple REST application] +

This project shows how you can add health checks.

You start multiple javalin instances, each running on a different port. This way you can use javalin
running on port 8080 for handling your business requests, and all 'management' requests (including a
health check) on port 8090. You could restrict port 8090 to block requsts from the outside.
